# A TensorFlow implementation of DeepMind's WaveNet paper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ibab/tensorflow-wavenet)

This is a TensorFlow implementation of the [WaveNet generative neural
network architecture](https://deepmind.com/blog/wavenet-generative-model-raw-audio/) for audio generation.

<table style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>
<p>
The WaveNet neural network architecture directly generates a raw audio waveform,
showing excellent results in text-to-speech and general audio generation (see the
DeepMind blog post and paper for details).
</p>
<p>
The network models the conditional probability to generate the next
sample in the audio waveform, given all previous samples and possibly
additional parameters.
</p>
<p>
After an audio preprocessing step, the input waveform is quantized to a fixed integer range.
The integer amplitudes are then one-hot encoded to produce a tensor of shape <code>(num_samples, num_channels)</code>.
</p>
<p>
A convolutional layer that only accesses the current and previous inputs then reduces the channel dimension.
</p>
<p>
The core of the network is constructed as a stack of <em>causal dilated layers</em>, each of which is a
dilated convolution (convolution with holes), which only accesses the current and past audio samples.
</p>
<p>
The outputs of all layers are combined and extended back to the original number
of channels by a series of dense postprocessing layers, followed by a softmax
function to transform the outputs into a categorical distribution.
</p>
<p>
The loss function is the cross-entropy between the output for each timestep and the input at the next timestep.
</p>

## Requirements

TensorFlow needs to be installed before running the training script.
TensorFlow 0.10 and the current `master` version are supported.

In addition:
[librosa](https://github.com/librosa/librosa) must be installed for reading and writing audio.
[PIL Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) must be installed for reading and writing images.

To install the required python packages (except TensorFlow), run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the network

You can use any corpus containing `.wav` files.
We've mainly used the [VCTK corpus](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jyamagis/page3/page58/page58.html) (around 10.4GB, [Alternative host](http://www.udialogue.org/download/cstr-vctk-corpus.html)) so far.

In order to train the network, execute
```bash
python train.py --data_dir=corpus
```
to train the network, where `corpus` is a directory containing `.wav` files.
The script will recursively collect all `.wav` files in the directory.

You can see documentation on each of the training settings by running
```bash
python train.py --help
```

You can find the configuration of the model parameters in [`wavenet_params.json`](./wavenet_params.json).
These need to stay the same between training and generation.

You can train and generate not only wav files but also texts and images:

The only thing it has to be done is change two parameters in the [`wavenet_params.json`](./wavenet_params.json):

```
{
....
"raw_type": "Audio",
"file_ext": "*.wav"
}
```

In this way, you can train the model with texts by just copying a folder with texts and setting these two parameters in [`wavenet_params.json`](./wavenet_params.json) to:

```
{
....
"raw_type": "Text",
"file_ext": "*.txt"
}
```
- A version of this WaveNet text generator has been used for poem generation here: [Wavenet for Poem Generation](http://bdp.glia.ca/wavenet-for-poem-generation-preliminary-results/)

For image training:

```
{
....
"raw_type": "Image",
"file_ext": "*.jpg"
}
```

The file_ext parameter can be changed to any pattern like ".gif", ".mp3", etc.

## Generating ouputs

[Example output](https://soundcloud.com/user-731806733/tensorflow-wavenet-500-msec-88k-train-steps)
generated by @jyegerlehner based on speaker 280 from the VCTK corpus.

You can use the `generate.py` script to generate audio using a previously trained model.

Run
```
python generate.py --samples 16000 model.ckpt-1000
```
where `model.ckpt-1000` needs to be a previously saved model.
You can find these in the `logdir`.
The `--samples` parameter specifies how many audio samples you would like to generate (16000 corresponds to 1 second by default).

The generated waveform can be played back using TensorBoard, or stored as a file by using the `--file_out_path` parameter:
```
python generate.py --file_out_path=generated.wav --samples 16000 model.ckpt-1000
```

Passing `--save_every` in addition to `--file_out_path` will save the in-progress file every n samples.
```
python generate.py --file_out_path=generated.wav --save_every 2000 --samples 16000 model.ckpt-1000
```

Fast generation is enabled by default.
It uses the implementation from the [Fast Wavenet](https://github.com/tomlepaine/fast-wavenet) repository.
You can follow the link for an explanation of how it works.
This reduces the time needed to generate samples to a few minutes.

To disable fast generation:
```
python generate.py --samples 16000 model.ckpt-1000 --fast_generation=false
```

## Running tests

Install the test requirements
```
pip install -r requirements_test.txt
```

Run the test suite
```
./ci/test.sh
```

## Missing features

Currently, there is no conditioning on extra information like the speaker ID.
